## Description

This is an express.js API for handling the backend of an ecommerce site. When a user adds the database name, MySQL username, and MySQL password to a .env file, then that user is allowed to connect to the database throgh sequelize.js. A user then utilizes the schema to create the database in MySQL, and runs "npm run seed" from the command line terminal to seed the database with the prepared information. When the user runs "node server.js" or "npm run start" from the command line terminal, the server is connected and the sequelize models are synced to the database. When the user opens a GET route in Insomnia (or similar client), the data for each GET route is displayed in JSON. Utilizing the POST, PUT, and DELETE routes for each database table allows the user to add, update, and delete information from the associated table in the database.
